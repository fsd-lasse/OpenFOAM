Overview
========
+ Template case for wallHeatFluxHTC function object
+ Modified from etc/templates/axisymmetricJet
+ The main purpose of this template is to demonstrate heat transfer coefficient 
  calculation using wallHeatFluxHTC function object
+ Note that the mesh is of low quality and the result is inaccurate

wallHeatFluxHTC
=======
+ is called from controlDict as 

    functions
    {
        heatTransferCoefficient
        {
            type            wallHeatFluxHTC;
            libs            ("mylibfieldFunctionObjects.so");
            patches         ("heatedWall");
            htc             true;
            Tref            300.15;
            writeControl    timeStep;
            timeInterval    1;
            log             yes;
        }
    }

+ saves field htc and wallHeatFlux in time folders
