Validation case for jouleHeatingFoam
Antti Mikkonen, a.mikkonen@iki.fi, 2017

For a constant cross-section resistive material
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistivity_and_conductivity)
    R = rho * l / A, 

In our test case
    A = 1mm x 1mm = 1e-6 m^2
    l = 1m
    rho = 1, rho0=1 and alpha = 0
    V = 1 V
    
From the correlation        
    R = rho * l / A = 1e6 ohm
For total current 
    I = V / R = 1e-6 A
For Joule heating the analytical solution is
    P = V * I = 1e-6 W
    
CFD solution

    jouleHeatingFoam
gives
    Info:
    Current out - in    = -5.38326e-15 A
    Total current       = 1e-06 A
    Total Joule heating = 1e-06 W
