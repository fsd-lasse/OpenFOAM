Example case for jouleHeatingFoam
Antti Mikkonen, a.mikkonen@iki.fi, 2017

A steinless stell plate with dimensions 150x287x0.2mm^3 is heated electrically
with 1V voltage. The plate has a non-uniform temperature field (setFields) and 
therefore non-uniform resistivity. The goal is to solve the local Joule heating 
in the plate. For more details see the dissertation by the author 
(not yet published).
